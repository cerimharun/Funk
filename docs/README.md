This thesis aims to implement a functional library for C# programming language.

Bugs in software are very common due to mistakes developers make in the source code. For example, in the case of the programs written in the C# programming language, one of the most common runtime errors is the notorious `NullReferenceException`. 

To help developers address these bugs and to make them trust their codebase without writing a *defensive code*, the library will utilize many concepts from functional programming languages such as F# and Scala including **immutability**, **pattern matching**, and various types of **monads** together with stronger typing. The introduction of these concepts into the language will help in avoiding many bugs and boilerplate code. It will improve expressiveness and enable developers to write code in a declarative rather than in an imperative way.

The following specific tasks should also be performed within the scope of this thesis project:
- analyze and compare this library with existing functional libraries such as language-ext and FuncSharp.
- analyze new features of the C# 8.0 language that include nullable reference types and pattern matching.
