## Minimalistic Functional Library for C#

Funk implements many concepts from functional programming languages to reduce code size and most importantly help developers write **honest** bug-free code.

Many agree that code is a liability where each line is a **commitment** and an **asset**. By using Funk you reduce the code size, end up with less commitment and keep all the good parts. Funk helps developers write code in a declarative rather than in an imperative way. It offers structures for representing and working with objects in a functional way. It introduces pattern matching for earlier versions of C#. It also provides extensions for working with immutable types painlessly. Expressions become a natural way of writing code where statements can be completely omitted.
