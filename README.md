**Diploma thesis topic:**

The aim of this thesis is to implement a functional library for C# programming language. Some of the most common exceptions that occur during runtime of the application are [**System.NullReferenceException**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.nullreferenceexception?view=netframework-4.8) and [**System.InvalidCastException**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.invalidcastexception?view=netframework-4.8).
To solve these kinds of issues, the library will utilize many concepts from functional programming languages such as F# and Scala including immutability, pattern matching and monads by introducing stronger typing. Introducing these concepts into the language will help in avoiding bugs and boilerplate code and therefore have a code written in a declarative rather than in an imperative way. Moreover, the thesis will analyze and compare this library with existing functional libraries such as language-ext and FuncSharp. The thesis will also analyze new features of the C# 8.0 that include nullable reference types and pattern matching.
